# Inside the Team
Besides working on the daily tasks, we give each member of the team a chance to get involved in additional activities as part of the regular working hours. There are 3 types of activites or initatives that we tackle, some of them are ongoing and some of them are happening one time:
* personal development activities
* internal company activities
* external company activities

### Personal Development Activities
While personal development should also be done during your own time, we try to offer as much time as possible for personal development during the working hours. We schedule together R&D, open-source or just learning activities that one takes ownership of. Let's say that for example that you want to learn [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or you want to play a little with [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/). We plan this together with the rest of the team and you have a number of hours allocated to learning this during the working hours. The only condition is to prepare a dissemination of what you found out / learned during the time with the entire team, so that knowledge is distributed to all members. Similarly, you can opt-in to contribute to one of the open-source projects we started on [github](https://github.com/FortechRomania) or to start another one and we plan together some sessions with the team for analysis and review.

### Internal Company Activities
This can vary from participating in tech interviews, to mentoring people as part of our [internship program](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/we-train/junior-development-program/). If you are more interested in teaching we are heavily involved in internal and external training activities, so we will definitely find time for this. We are also involved in developing some internal tooling for our support departments, so be ready for some potential work in that area.

### External Company Activities
These are the kind of activities that are helping us indirectly by creating a stronger brand around the team/company. But also they can help you build a stronger brand for yourself. So this can vary from being involved into the tech-sales process at Fortech, to speaking at events and conferences and to creating blog posts or external content for our company.

Overall, these activities are molding you into a better professional and are allowing you to try different types of responsibilities to see which one fits you better.
