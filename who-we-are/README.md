# Who we are
We are a growing team of professionals focusing our skills and efforts around the JavaScript ecosystem (and not only). We work in a collaborative way on multiple projects, while still making sure everyone in the team adheres to our common vision and culture.

We wanted to write a few lines about the team name `Cake for Breakfast` but itâ€™s self-explanatory anyway and we were too busy... ðŸ‘‡

### You are always part of the team
Before we start talking about *what* and *how* we work, let's make something clear: at any time, in any setup, under any circumstances, we are part of the **same team**. This is the corner stone of our team culture. Each and every member of the team is **equal** to the other and we all contribute to the development of the team. It doesn't matter if we work in different teams, on different projects with different customers. At the end of the day, we are part of the same team.

### Why culture matters

Team work is a winner in today's software development world, that's a no brainer. Everyone understands the importance of team work and collaboration, but a team is more than the individuals that form it and the relations between them. The team exists outside the context of each individual and the team carries on, as long as the culture formed around it is strong. A strong team culture means that no individual is irreplaceable, but at the same time all individuals are valuable and an integral part of the team.

We work in an environment where everyone collaborates, help and support are unconditioned and the needs of the team come before the needs of the individual.

### A culture built on mentoring

We believe mentoring is the key to success. It doesn't matter if you have 10 years of experience or 3 months, in our team you will be both a mentor and a mentee. From our [junior development program](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/tree/master/we-train/junior-development-program) to our montly initiatives of learning and development, everything we do is based on learning, teaching and sharing. Some of our initiatives are also based on giving back to the community, so be ready to embrace mentoring and teaching as a primary activity.

### Our core values

Althought our team is built around technology and the JavaScript ecosystem, our core values are not technology focused. They represent the sum of the human traits that we value most.

#### Passion

The main driver of most of our activities. It's hard to work in the software industry without passion. Hard work and skills will solve one problem at a time, passion will deliver the end result.

#### Honesty

We are not superstars, we are not all-knowing gods, everyone has flaws, gaps in knowledge and lack of understanding in all sorts of areas. We value honesty first and as long as there's willingness to learn and adapt, we can work with you. We do not value a cocky attitude towards colleagues and technology.

#### Motivation

Are willing to go the extra mile? Everyone has different incentives of motivation but we always value the positive motivation. Each team member is committed and engaged in what he or she does, whether it's about writing code, teaching others or any other endevour.

#### Curiosity

How much time do you spend exploring new things? Do you have a keen interest in technology and its evolution? Our wish is to empower people to try things out, to test new concepts, new tools and frameworks. Curiosity drives innovation and evolution.

#### Perseverence

Without it, dealing with complicated tasks becomes a burden. It's not only about hard work, it's also about asking all the right questions, getting deeper into the code to find the true source of a problem or making sure you covered all the cases.
