## The art of clean code and consistency

Writting code is an essential part our day to day activity. While working together for several years now, we saw that adopting a single guideline for the entire team is very beneficial and powerful. Choosing between two or more ways of writing code can lead to a lot of [bikeshedding](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding).

### Styleguide

We follow most of the [airbnb styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), which we highly recommend you read and understand before coming to an interview or sharing some code to us.

However, we adapted some of the rules, to enhance readability and based on some debated preferences of the team members. You can read more about our reasoning [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/adding-some-air-to-the-airbnb-style-guide-3df40e31c57a).

On our projects, we are using the following [ESLint config](https://github.com/FortechRomania/eslint-config-fortech) to make sure we all stick to the same guidelines. What's more, we make sure that code that does not pass the linter, does not end up in the central repository.

### Clean code

On top of a healthy coding styleguide comes the craftsmanship for writing clean and reusable code. We are 100% oriented towards quality and resilience when writing code. In our view, clean code equals less time spent over time refactoring and keeping the codebase up to date. We strongly encourage everyone that joins or wants to join the team to get familiar as soon as possible with the main principles behind clean code, many of which are addressed in Robert Martin's [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
