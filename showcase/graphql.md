# GraphQL

### Getting Started with GraphQL
Before jumping into GraphQL you must understand what it is and that it comes as an alternative to traditional REST APIs. One important note is that GraphQL is not tied to any specific language or framework. It is just a protocol used for communicating between clients and servers.

### GraphQL and Apollo
This 6-part article is a great reference to start building a React app powered by a GraphQL backend. **Apollo** is an easy-to-use client for GraphQL which allows you to write queries and mutations on any frontend application in order to communicate with a GraphQL endpoint. This series of articles goes through the basic functionalities exposed by **React-Apollo**, the library used for connecting React apps to GraphQL.
