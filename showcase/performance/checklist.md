# Performance Checklist

## Introduction

We see performance as an integral part of the quality of the software that we build. There's no need to re-emphasize the importance of performance in the modern web. We strongly belive that it is our duty to provide to our users a slick and fast UX, so we try to include performance optimizations in our regular working process.

Here are a couple of areas that revolve around web performance. They will be later grouped into **front-end**, **back-end** and **tooling**, but for now let's look at where we can actually improve the performance of our web applications.

* Optimizing Critical Rendering Path
* Keeping the bundle size to a minimum
* Image Optimization
* Interactivity and Animations
* Backend Optimizations
* Server Optimizations
* Performance Tests and Tools
* Load Tests and Tools
