### There are no stupid questions
Ask, always ask when something is unclear. Don't let loose ends in your knowledge and don't allow fear (of being wrong or not knowing) cripple your learning and development path. Also, asking early on is easier (and less judged if you want) than asking months down the road. We are here to guide you and answer your questions.

### When stuck, put yourself a time limit for debugging
Our team says one of the juniors's guilt is spending too much time trying to solve something on your own when youâ€™re stuck, instead of asking for help. Do not agonize over it, ask for help (sooner rather than later).

P.S. Having a system in place is a good idea. Have a time limit for how much time you allow yourself to spend on it. Search what the www says, check notes, try things, get a [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), but when ideas run out, just put your ego aside and ask for help. We have all been there.

### Learn from others, help others learn from you
Be open minded and accept input, suggestions. At the same time, don't let the _junior_ position make you feel like the others cannot learn from you. There are for sure interests of yours, both technical and non-technical, that you can bring to the table and that make you valuable.

### Be pragmatic, not perfectionist
Finding the perfect solution should not be your utmost goal. Getting things done and iteratively improving them depending on the available time is far preferred than spending days without delivering. Be agile.

### Hone your craft, reserve time for deliberate practice
Take time to play without having the pressure to necessarily finish a pet project. The point is to experiment and get a deeper understanding of the niche you want to focus on.

### Try things, but don't follow every trend
Be critical and in here you can also suggest debates within our team.

### Aim for simplicity
Whenever in doubt, choose the simple way, the simple solution, the simple anything.

### You code for people, not for machines
While your code needs to be run on computers, remember that ultimately, your code needs to be clear for people. And those people might be _you_ in a couple of years.

### Master your tools
Make your life easier by learning your tools, whether we are talking about editors, shells or keyboard shortcuts.

### Be grateful for every code review because someone helps you get better
Of course, you can also take it personal, but you should not. Try to learn from these suggestions and also appreciate the fact that someone did care enough to submit a review.

### Keep a brag file
Keep a file where you log your progress and brag yourself for your achievements. Whether you do that daily or weekly, it might serve both as a reflection point to see how far you have come, but also on your next review meeting with your manager.
