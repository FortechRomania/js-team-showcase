## JavaScript

### Setup node
In order to run JS only example, you should be familiar with how to run scripts with node, how to use dependencies and npm. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be able to install npm packages and run any js file in node for exercising purposes. Read more about [npm and package.json](https://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-node-package-manager/).

### Functions
Get familiar with JavaScript functions:
* [Function Definitions](http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html)
* [Callbacks](https://dev.to/faradayyg/understanding-javascript-callbacks-58i)
* [Scopes](https://scotch.io/tutorials/understanding-scope-in-javascript)
* [Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)
* [Modules](https://toddmotto.com/mastering-the-module-pattern/)

### Modern JavaScript

Take a [history lesson](https://auth0.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-javascript/) of JavaScript the EcmaScript Standard.
* [ECMAScript2015/ES6](http://es6-features.org/#Constants)
* [Egghead course on ES2015](https://egghead.io/courses/learn-es6-ecmascript-2015)
* [ES Modules](http://2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html)

### Get familiar with Javascript
Read [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html) to learn about Values, Types, Operators and Data structures. The first 6 chapters should be enough to cover the ground for QA Automation.
You should read [this book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029557.do) in order to get familiar with Objects, Arrays and other data structures. Each step should be code reviewed by your mentor.
Also read [chapter 3](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000262/ch03.html) from Programming JavaScript Applications.

### Clean Code
Watch [Clean Code Fundamentals](https://cleancoders.com/videos/clean-code/fundamentals) especially focusing on episodes 2 to 5, which are the foundation of well engineered code.

### JavaScript Styleguide
Read about [airbnb's styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and the rules they enforce through it. Also install the official [fortech styleguide](https://github.com/FortechRomania/eslint-config-fortech) which is inheriting the airbnb one with a few notable changes. Make sure you setup your future projects using this eslint config package.

### Asynchronous Programming
Learn about the model of execution in JavaScript and the call stack. Wrap your head around asynchronous programming with the following resources:
* [Understand the event loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)
* [Promises](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-promises-for-dummies)
* [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
* [Async/Await](https://tutorialzine.com/2017/07/javascript-async-await-explained)
* [Async/Await full tutorial](https://egghead.io/courses/asynchronous-javascript-with-async-await)

### Functional Programming
You can follow a couple of example from [this workshop](). Focus on:
* [High Order Functions](https://egghead.io/courses/mastering-asynchronous-programming-the-end-of-the-loop)
* [Partial Application](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/curry-or-partial-application-8150044c78b8)
* [Function Composition](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-function-composition-20dfb109a1a0)

### Exercises
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
* [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/javascript)
* [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

### Recommended time
This module should take 2 to 3 weeks of learning and practicing.

### Measurable progress
At the end of this module you should be familiar with the core concepts and paradigms revolving around JavaScript. You should also be able to write clean and efficient code following our guidelines.
