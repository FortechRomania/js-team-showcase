## The Web Platform

### The Internet
Understand [how the internet works](https://ed.ted.com/on/tdUFCocK).

Understand the [Client-Server Architecture](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/software-architecture/client-server-architecture.html) in the context of software architecture.

### Browsers
At this [link](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/) you can find an interesting tutorial that includes general functioning of a browser, its structure, rendering engines and HTML or CSS code parsing.

### HTTP Protocol
Learn a little about HTTP and HTTPS. Understand the following:
* [Requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
* [Responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)
* [Methods](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_methods.htm)
* [Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)

### REST and Web APIs 
What is CRUD and what is a [RESTful API](http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html)?

Practice API skills on the [tutorial](https://www.lynda.com/Flask-tutorials/CRUD-REST-basics/521200/533063-4.html).

Install [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/postman) and play around with the tool.

### Browser APIs
* What is a [cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)?
* What is a [session](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Session)?
* What is [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)?

### Recommended time
This module should take approximately 1 week of learning and practicing.

### Measurable progress
At the end of this module you should have a good understanding of how the web platform is working and how browsers work. You should also be able to understand HTTP communication and the separation between the server and the client. You should also be able to simulate different types of requests using Postman.
