# QA Automation Engineer Roadmap

Welcome to our development program for QA Automation Engineers! This is roughly a 3-month program at a regular pace (8h/day) that will bring pleasure into your life by learning automation testing. We'll learn about test design, the web platform, Javascript and a lot more.

## Basics and Setup
We can only build on a solid foundation, so we're starting with the basics:
* Creating a git repository 
* Setting up an automation project
* Test case design
* Identifying elements
* Write the scripts
* Test debugging

+ If we got your attention, read the [Qa basics](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/we-train/junior-development-program/qa-automation/qa-basics.md) and [Setup](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/we-train/junior-development-program/qa-automation/setup.md) files for further information.

## The Web Platform
To test something properly, it is crucial to understand the context in which you're working in. This is why you should 'inspect' the [Web Platform](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/we-train/junior-development-program/qa-automation/web-platform.md).

## Introduction to programming
We understand that creating and maintaining an automation test suite is every child's dream growing up, but it's easier said than done. To be able to write the tests of your dreams, you'll first need to understand a programming language and to master it. This will be your foundation on building automated test scenarios. You'll be introduced in the world of programming and learn [Javascript](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/we-train/junior-development-program/qa-automation/javascript.md).

## Tools
Problems solved > problems caused. This is the basic expression on which we select our tools. If you'd like to know what tools we use and exactly how, just check [this](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/we-train/junior-development-program/qa-automation/automation-tools.md) out.
