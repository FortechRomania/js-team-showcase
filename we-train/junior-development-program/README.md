# Junior Development Program
During the last couple of years we have perfected this program through which we want to help you develop your skills as a junior engineer. We work mainly on two areas: **Full Stack JavaScript Engineers** and **QA Automation Engineers**.

No prior work experience is required for joining this program.

We offer a 3-month program during which you will be guided through the world of JavaScript, from basic algorithms and data structures to patterns of functional programming and object-oriented programming. Each junior has a **mentor** that guides him throughout the 3 months. In parallel with the training curricula, the juniors are joining the team in all activities, including *workshops*, *R&D projects* and *showcases*. 

Based on the specifics of the branch you follow and the context inside the team, the last period can be dedicated to a specific technology, whether it's on building a UI Automation Framework with JavaScript, or building a React/Angular frontend application, or a Node.js server side web app.

If you are interested in apply for the program, read more about our selection process for [full stack engineers](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/we-train/junior-development-program/dev-selection-process.md) and [qa automation engineers](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/we-train/junior-development-program/qa-selection-process.md).
