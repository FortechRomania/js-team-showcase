# Full-Stack Engineer Roadmap

Welcome to our development program for Full-stack JavaScript Engineers! This is roughly a 3-month program at a regular pace (8h/day) that will take you through the awesome ecosystem of web development, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and much more!

Are you ready? Let's start!

## Code module

We strongly believe that core skills come before learning to use libraries and frameworks. So a lot of your learning focus will be dedicated to understanding the basis web development is based upon. After finishing the code module, you will be able to learn any backend/frontend framework and you will have a much better understanding of what's under the hood of modern web applications.

The core module is built out of the following sub-modules:
* [Introduction and Setup](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/we-train/junior-development-program/full-stack/setup.md)
* [The Web Platform](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/we-train/junior-development-program/full-stack/web-platform.md)
* [HTML/CSS](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/we-train/junior-development-program/full-stack/html-css.md)
* [JavaScript](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/we-train/junior-development-program/full-stack/javascript.md)

## Specialization

Now that you have a strong foundation, it's time to build!

Currently we have development programs for the following specializations:
* [React](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/we-train/junior-development-program/full-stack/reactjs.md)
* [Angular](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/we-train/junior-development-program/full-stack/angular.md)
* [Node](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/we-train/junior-development-program/full-stack/nodejs.md)
