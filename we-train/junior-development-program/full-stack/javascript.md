## JavaScript

### Setup node
In order to run JS only example, you should be familiar with how to run scripts with node, how to use dependencies and npm.

Install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or node version manager. This will help you switch between different versions of node with ease. Read more about [npm and package.json](https://www.sitepoint.com/beginners-guide-node-package-manager/).

### Data Structures and Algorithms
You should read [this book](https://github.com/amilajack/reading/blob/master/JavaScript/Learning%20Javascript%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms.pdf) in order to get familiar with Lists, Queues, Trees and other data structures. Each step should be code reviewed by your mentor.

### Functions
Get familiar with JavaScript functions:
* [Function Definitions](http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html)
* [Callbacks](https://dev.to/faradayyg/understanding-javascript-callbacks-58i)
* [Scopes](https://scotch.io/tutorials/understanding-scope-in-javascript)
* [Closures](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/lets-learn-javascript-closures-66feb44f6a44)
* [Modules](https://toddmotto.com/mastering-the-module-pattern/)

### Modern JavaScript
Understand [the modern JavaScript ecosystem](https://medium.com/@peterxjang/modern-javascript-explained-for-dinosaurs-f695e9747b70) based on npm modules.

Take a [history lesson](https://auth0.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-javascript/) of JavaScript the EcmaScript Standard.
* [ECMAScript2015/ES6](http://es6-features.org/#Constants)
* [Egghead course on ES2015](https://egghead.io/courses/learn-es6-ecmascript-2015)
* [ES Modules](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/)

### Objects and OOP
Read [chapter 4](http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html) of Eloquent JavaScript, about Objects and Arrays.

Also read [chapter 3](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000262/ch03.html) from Programming JavaScript Applications.

### Clean Code
Watch [Clean Code Fundamentals](https://cleancoders.com/videos/clean-code/fundamentals) especially focusing on episodes 2 to 5, which are the foundation of well engineered code.

Read more about [clean code concepts](https://alistapart.com/article/coding-with-clarity): Single Responsibility Principle, High Cohesion, Low Coupling.

### JavaScript Styleguide
Read about [airbnb's styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and the rules they enforce through it. Also install the official [fortech styleguide](https://github.com/FortechRomania/eslint-config-fortech) which is inheriting the airbnb one with a few notable changes. Make sure you setup your future projects using this eslint config package.

### Unit testing
Test suites ensure that our code is stable as we perform changes or refactor over time. Test some of your existing code with mocha following [this tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/unit-test-javascript-mocha-chai/). Make sure you write tests for all the remaining exercises you do.

[Further reading](https://medium.com/welldone-software/an-overview-of-javascript-testing-in-2018-f68950900bc3) on unit testing and all the elements of the testing ecosystem.

### Asynchronous Programming
Learn about the model of execution in JavaScript and the call stack. Wrap your head around asynchronous programming with the following resources:
* [Understand the event loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)
* [Promises](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-promises-for-dummies)
* [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
* [Async/Await](https://tutorialzine.com/2017/07/javascript-async-await-explained)
* [Async/Await full tutorial](https://egghead.io/courses/asynchronous-javascript-with-async-await)

### Functional Programming
You can follow a couple of example from [this workshop](https://github.com/alexnm/functional-javascript-workshop). Focus on:
* [High Order Functions](https://egghead.io/courses/mastering-asynchronous-programming-the-end-of-the-loop)
* [Partial Application](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/curry-or-partial-application-8150044c78b8)
* [Function Composition](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-function-composition-20dfb109a1a0)

### Excercises
Practice your combined HTML, CSS and JS skills on the following tasks:
* [Infinite Image Carousel](https://amazingcarousel.com/examples/jquery-image-carousel-slider-id13/)
* [Range Slider](http://rangeslider.js.org/)

Build a modern project setup following [this tutorial](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/javascript-development-environment).

### Recommended time
This module should take 5 to 6 weeks of learning and practicing.

### Measurable progress
At the end of this module you should be familiar with the core concepts and paradigms revolving around JavaScript. You should also be able to write clean, tested and efficient code following our guidelines. Finally, you should understand how to build a modern JavaScript driven project with ES2015 and Webpack.
