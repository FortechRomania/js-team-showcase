## Introduction and Setup

### Setup Github account.
For guidance check out this [tutorial from GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

Learn [Git essentials on lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Git-Essential-Training/100222-2.html)

### Setup editor of choice.
We recommend one on the following:
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)

Add plugins like [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) or [Emmet](https://emmet.io/) to your editor.

### Access to resources
Fortech employees have access to our company accounts for the following resources:
* [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/)
* [Egghead](https://egghead.io/)

We recommend them as excellent sources of online materials, but of course you can learn from your own sources if you wish.

### Recommended time
While the rest of the chapters are quantifiable in time, this one should be pretty straight forward and not time bound. 

### Measurable progress
At the end of this module you should have a good understanding of the basic git commands (clone, commit, push, pull, merge) and should be able to create a project structure with different file types (html, css, js) inside your editor of choice.
