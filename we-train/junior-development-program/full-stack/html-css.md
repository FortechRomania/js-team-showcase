## HTML/CSS

### HTML
Understand the basic structure of an HTML file.

Learn about elements and attributes by practicing on this [tutorial](https://www.lynda.com/HTML-tutorials/HTML-Essential-Training/170427-2.html). Another good tutorial can be found at this [link](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/).

### CSS
[This course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/css-intro) is all about the basics. Focus on layouting: on float, flexbox and grid layouting.

Learn about element [positioning](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/css-positioning-1834). Play around with relative, absolute, fixed and static positions.

[A nice read](https://medium.com/actualize-network/modern-css-explained-for-dinosaurs-5226febe3525) to get a good understanding of the entire modern css ecosystem.

### Excercises
Practice your HTML and CSS skills on the following tasks:
* [blog homepage](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzeWN3ftbKueZlh2LTRWNE9Dc2c/view)
* [infinite image carousel](https://amazingcarousel.com/examples/jquery-image-carousel-slider-id13/)
* [range slider](http://rangeslider.js.org/)

Remember: only HTML and CSS. Your code should not have any JavaScript/jQuery code.
