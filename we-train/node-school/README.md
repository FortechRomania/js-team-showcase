[Nodeschool](https://nodeschool.io/) is an open-source platform aimed at teaching basic JavaScript skills to everyone. The event is held in a lot of countries worldwide and we're bringing it to Cluj as one of our team activities, with the mentors being members of our js team.

Our latest event took place on the **9th of December 2017** and it exceeded our expectations.

In spite of the gloomy December morning, the latest Nodeschool Cluj event gathered almost 40 participants from all walks of life. The event took place in the fancy cafeteria at Fortech's headquarter in Cluj-Napoca.

Together with the awesome mentors, our guests spent most of the day hacking in the console, trying to figure out the javascripting challenges. The tasks consist of working on small tasks meant to take the user from absolute beginner to a level where one can feel comfortable writing simple programs in Javascript.

## Back to the basics
Important to note that the focus of the workshop was on the language itself and not on the environment where Javascript runs. As one of the mentors pointed out in the first presentation, Javascript nowadays runs everywhere, from browsers and server to Internet of Things (IoT) devices. 

So building a strong foundation is the key that can ultimately enable the writing of robust apps, no matter where they run.

## Focus on learning
Trying to figure out the longest word in a string, a Fibonacci sequence or the bubble sort algorithm proved hard for some, easy for others but fun for everybody. 

Solving problems is what programming is all about. But doing this along with others, in a controlled environment where mentors are always ready to step in is a lot more satisfying. As one participant put it,

> "you can focus on what is important, and that is learning, instead of wasting time trying to fix syntax errors".

## Sharing is caring
While some of the mentors talked about the core skills a programmer should strive to acquire, others spoke about their time as interns while attending the Junior Development Program program at Fortech.

The panel proved particularly useful since most of the attendees were curious to find out how such programs actually work and what can one expect at the end of the training period.

## Next steps: bigger, better

In the aftermath of the event some new ideas started to take shape among the mentors. Some of the discussions regarding future events lead to a few key points:

- future events will have a clearly outlined attendee level requirement. This means we will have different events for absolute beginners, novices and people who've used Javascript before.
- the target is to have more participants and more mentors, keeping the same learning experience but aiming for maximum impact.

While we wait for participant feedback to start dripping in, we are already cooking up the next event, which will probably take part in March 2018.
