## A word from the engineering team
Would you like to know more about us? What we work on? How we work? Read through this repository to get a better understanding of our team culture.

If you think **JavaScript** is the present and the future, we welcome you to our full stack development team.

### About the team
We are a growing team of professionals focusing our skills and efforts around the JavaScript ecosystem (and not only). We work in a collaborative way on multiple projects, while still making sure everyone in the team adheres to our common vision and culture.

### What we do
We work on various projects from vanilla **JavaScript**, to REST APIs with **Express** and **Koa**, to complex front-end applications with **React** and **Angular** and native mobile applications with **React Native**. We are pushing the limits of the web and mobile every day and we challenge each other to come up with the best solutions for our customers.

### How we do it
We have a strong [team culture](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/team-culture.md) built around a few core values

We value clean code and reusable code and we follow a [common styleguide](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/coding-guidelines.md) to achieve that.

We believe in mentoring, in teaching and sharing information. One of our mentoring activities is the [junior academy program](https://github.com/FortechRomania/js-team-showcase/blob/master/internship-process.md).
