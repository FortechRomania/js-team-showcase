# How we work

We're describing here our work processes and the way in which we understand software quality. You can read more about **code quality**, **standard setup** and our **software engineering process**.

Our project setups are pretty straight-forward, you can have a look at a few example/starter projects:
* [Node Starter](https://github.com/FortechRomania/node-starter)
* [Express + Mongo Example](https://github.com/FortechRomania/express-mongo-example-project)
* [React Starter](https://github.com/FortechRomania/react-starter-kit)
* [React + Redux Example](https://github.com/FortechRomania/react-redux-complete-example)
