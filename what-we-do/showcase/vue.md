### Fresh start
In case you are new to the world of frontend libraries and frameworks, I think the [official documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) is the right way to start. Forget about the vue-cli and the other tools around the ecosystem and get up to speed with vue in a regular old fashion single html file.

### With prior experience
If you worked with similar frontend frameworks before (ex: React, Angular) and you are aware of the modern JavaScript ecosystem (ex: Webpack, ES2015, Babel), then the *vue-cli* is the best option to get started fast with Vue.

We highly recommend you follow this [5-part article](https://css-tricks.com/guides/vue/) written by Sarah Drasner which takes you through the entire Vue ecosystem. I strongly advise you follow along and write your own code, while playing around with the Vue components. [Vue Devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) is also a great addition to your browser.

#### Vuex
If you have some experience with Redux, you can have a look at how Vuex works in conjunction with Vue. [The official guide](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/) is a good way to start. You will need to understand what mutations and actions are because they differ a bit from what you may know from Redux. A good guide can be found on [vueschool.io](https://vueschool.io/courses/vuex-for-everyone) (free course).

#### Things to follow
A couple of points where an in-depth understanding is needed in order to build a large scale application:
* [ ] working with forms
* [ ] integrating APIs
* [ ] server side rendering
* [ ] eslint config for Vue
